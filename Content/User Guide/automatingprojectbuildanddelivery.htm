        <p>The following are the steps to automate your project build and delivery using ContentMagic's automation engine:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Define your project requirements and create a workflow</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Set up the automation engine: Log in to your <MadCap:variable name="ContentMagic.Product Name" /> account and navigate to the Automation Engine section. From there, you can create a new automation workflow for your project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose the tasks to automate: Select the tasks that you want to automate, such as content creation, editing, review, and publishing. You can also set up triggers for each task, such as a specific date or time, or when a specific event occurs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Configure the automation workflow: Configure each task in your automation workflow, specifying the settings, parameters, and rules for each task. For example, you can specify the target audience, keywords, and SEO settings for your content, or set up approval workflows for content review.</p>
